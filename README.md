# K-Means Grouping Project

<h2> Objective </h2>
Create a K-Means grouping model that separates people into mixed and diverse groups. In this case, a model was built for people differing in age, skill, and proficiency. This was done by taking people from different clusterings in the k-means model. 

<h2> Libraries and Languages </h2>

For the random data; Faker, CSV, NumPy, and Random, all in Python <br/>
For the k-means model; Pandas, NumPy, Kmodes, Kneed, and Datetime

<h2> Result </h2>
The K-means model grouped people into diverse groups, which was precisely what the model needed to do. It also can group people on group size. 

Combined with the frontend on Wix, the following CSV file could be generated using the data from the k-means model.
