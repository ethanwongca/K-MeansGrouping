# K-Means Grouping Project
Using a K-Means model to create groups 

<h2> Objective </h2>
Create a K-Means grouping model that seperates people into mixed and diverse groups. In this case a model was built for people differing in age, skill, and proficiency. This was done by taking people from different clusterings in the k-means model. 

<h2> Libraries and Languages </h2>

For the random data; faker, csv, numpy, and random, all in python
For the k-means model; pandas, numpy, kmodes, kneed, and datetime

<h2> Result </h2>
The K-means model grouped people into diverse groups, which was exactly what the model needed to do. It also can group people on group size. 

Combined with the front-end on wix, the following csv file could be generated using the data from the k-means model.
